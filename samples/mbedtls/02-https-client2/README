README

This sample contains a slightly modified version of programs/ssl/ssl_client2.c
from the mbed TLS project. It is written in C and uses the mbed TLS C API. The
class CKernel only provides the needed environment of a circle-stdlib
application.

The program requests the document https://elinux.org/Main_Page and displays the
received response (the HTTP header and TLS information). This sample can be
configured in some way. To change the configuration, you have to provide the
wanted options in the argv[] array in CKernel::Run() in the file kernel.cpp.

The transferred data will be encrypted, but normally there will be no
authentication, because the "auth_mode" is set to "none" and the provided
certificates do not match. If you want authentication, you have to provide the
matching certificates and to set "auth_mode" to "required".
