README

This sample program is only working on Raspberry Pi models with on-board
Ethernet controller or with on-board WLAN module (see next paragraph). Before
building it you may have to update the network configuration (DHCP is used by
default) in kernel.cpp to meet your local network configuration. Don't forget to
connect your local Ethernet to the Ethernet connector of the Raspberry Pi.

For WLAN operation you have to change the NET_DEVICE_TYPE define in kernel.cpp
to NetDeviceTypeWLAN. Please read the file libs/circle/addon/wlan/sample/README
for further information on how to prepare your SD card for WLAN operation.

The program fetches the document https://elinux.org/RPi_HardwareHistory and
parses it to find and display a Raspberry Pi hardware revision table as a comma
separated list. The revision entry of the board, on which the program is running
on, is displayed highlighted, if such entry exists.

By default this program does not authenticate the server. If you want server
authentication, just enter "make certs" to get the required certificate files
and put the .pem file(s) in this directory into the root directory of the SD
card, which is used to start your Raspberry Pi.

Please note that the HTML parser in this program may fail, if the document
changes heavily.
